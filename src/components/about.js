                Hi! I am a highly motivated full-stack developer who loves to work in teams and solve high level problems. I fell in love with coding after throwing myself into a full-stack bootcamp with no prior knowledge. It was intense, and left me wanting so much more. I am actively seeking a full-time development role where I can work on bigger projects and harder problems.
